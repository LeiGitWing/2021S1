# Assessment Task1    

## Question 1: Argument analysis

Since the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council created the E3 program, all new appliances have energy ratings so that consumers are more aware of the environmental impact of their purchase. In response, companies like Electrolux have created new types of washing machines designed to consume less energy. These new machines extract less water from laundry during their final spin cycles than do washing machines that consume somewhat more energy. The wetter the laundry, the more energy required to dry it in an automatic dryer. Thus, using these new types of washing machines could result in an overall increase in the energy needed to wash and dry a load of laundry.

 (2) Are the premises all true? If you do not know whether a premise is true, you can either do some research to find out (stating your sources) or say what sources you would need to use to find out the answer.

(3) Overall, is the argument sound? Briefly explain why or why not. 10
