## 0. Basices of integer representation 

Outcome:

- learn how integers are represented in binary, hexadecimal and octal.
- how to represet an unsigned integer in any of therse formats.
- two ways to represent signed integers



Question:





## 1. Intro to MIPS and its architecture

Outcome:

- the difference between RISC and CISC
- how the MIPS R2000 processor looks like, and its execution cycle
- how MIPS access main memory and the different segments



Notes:

**Part 1**

- why we need to learn machine code?
- words to loading and storing, which is 32 bites euqals to 4 bytes
- what's machine code
- what's assembler code?
- how the high-level language works in computer?
- Risc(reduced instruction set computer)
  - same length(32 bites)
  - of similar complexity(siimple)
  - mostly abble to run in same time
  - easily decoded and executed by computer hardware
- CISC(complex instruction set computer)
  - vary in length, complexity and execution time

- why mips?
- going deeper than you have with marie



**Part 2**

mips' main blocks and its execution cycle.

- main components
  - 32 general-purpose register
  - alu
  - Special-purpose register
- GPR
  - star with $
- purpose register, HI and LO
- special purpose register
- execution cycle
  - fetch the code(memory -> IR) 
  - decode
  - Execute 



**Part 3**

- how is the mips memory structured and accessed?
- segament
  - how segament works?
  - data segament
  - text segament
  - Heap segament
  - stack segament



**Part 4**

how does a mips program looks like? 

how do you add data? 

how to add comments?

- a mips program contains commnets, directives, instructuions, and lables



**Part 5**

- how to use few of the instructions?





Questions:

- what's machine code? What's the difference from machine language?
- what's the mips registers and how they work?
